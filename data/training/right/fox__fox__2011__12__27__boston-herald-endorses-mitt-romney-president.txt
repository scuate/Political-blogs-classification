Amid what they describe as " the quirkiest of Republican presidential primary seasons ", one of New England's most influential newspapers, the Boston Herald has endorsed Mitt Romney for president out of a " clown car" GOP field just a couple weeks before the New Hampshire primary . 

" There is only one candidate in the Republican field with the integrity, the experience, the organizational strength and the intelligence to beat Barack Obama , " the newspaper's editorial board writes. " There is only one candidate who can put this nation back on the path to fiscal sanity and restore it to its central role on the world stage. That candidate is Mitt Romney ." 

Romney's economic background and business acumen aslo weighed in on the editorial board's decision. 

" Romney's appeal at the national level is what it has always been here - he's a tough, no nonsense CEO who wants to bring a sense of trust back to government, "the endorsement reads. 

The Boston Herald also points to his appeal among independent voters, who are allowed to vote in New Hampshire's First-in-the-Nation primary. 

" He can attract to his candidacy that growing number of independent voters who will ultimately decide the presidency in November just as he did when he successfully ran for governor in this bluest of blue states," The editorial board argues.

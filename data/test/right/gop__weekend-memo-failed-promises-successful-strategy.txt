RE: Weekend Memo - Failed Promises, Successful Strategy 



Promises, promises. The president can make them, but he sure can't keep them. 

Happy Friday. With the Iowa Caucuses this week, the RNC took a look back at the many promises Candidate Obama made in Iowa four years ago. We released a hard-hitting  video  contrasting his promises with his record, we launched  FailedPromise.com  to list his Top 10 broken promises, and Chairman Priebus  penned  an op-ed for the  Des Moines Register  outlining the "Case for a New President." 

As the Chairman wrote, "Voters judge an incumbent president on one criterion: his record. A president is elected because of what he promises the country; he's re-elected if he fulfills those promises. And today, even President Obama's own team knows that he does not meet this most basic condition for re-election." 

Whether it's on the economy, jobs, healthcare, housing, energy, the deficit, the debt, or ethics, President Obama has broken countless promises to the American people. And at the RNC, we have them all documented. 

Our Research Department has written the Book on Obama's promises--literally, the Book. It's a 500-page electronically searchable database of quotes and videos--a catalog of every Obama utterance that, just as the  Washington Post  reported, "will form the backbone of the party's attack strategy against the president leading up to Election Day 2012." 

These aren't just generic, empty promises (though there are plenty of those, too). They are very specific, quantifiable promises--spending cuts, deficit reduction, unemployment numbers, and more. They are hard facts that the president has either ignored or forgotten. So it's up to us to hold him accountable to himself.  

Our analysis tells us this is a winning strategy. Poll after poll, focus group after focus group tells us this argument rings true with voters. It appeals to people's sense of reason and responsibility. It's a logical, reasonable, non-partisan argument. And it's especially salient with independent voters. 

This weekend, the Republican candidates will debate in New Hampshire. Once again, the focus will be on Republicans' vision for America. And once again, the RNC will use the primary as an opportunity to highlight Obama's broken promises, his failed policies, and his disastrous record. 

On  Fox News Sunday  this weekend, Chairman Priebus will make the same case. You can expect DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to make a feeble attempt at claiming that Obama has kept his promises. She can argue that all she wants, but she can't argue with the facts.  

Those facts are located, for your convenience, at  FailedPromise.com . And don't worry. We've got a whole lot more. Over 500 pages, in fact. That and much more, coming soon. 

Have a great weekend!
